# esLearning
This repository hosts a learning project on elastic search.
In doing this project, I followed different tutorials, the most importnat one being the playlist in https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXy8DQl3058OoJqGLFdqoBkBKm2T0kS9B
I also studied most of the queries on https://dzone.com/articles/23-useful-elasticsearch-example-queries article.
